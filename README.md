# slogan-maker
My favorite class project! Using data files of social media posts, I have created a program that provides a semi-realistic slogan from a given acronym. An external tokenizer class is being used to seperate each tweet into a collection of tokens. These tokens are used to create a list of bigrams, which are in turn used to construct slogans based on a given acronym that somewhat resemble real speech. 

## Next Steps

While this code runs, there are improvements that I envision. 

### 1. Efficiency

As I continue to learn more about sorting algorithms, data structures, and time complexities, I will use this project as an opportunity to apply my knowledge and constantly improve the efficiency of this software.

### 2. More Realistic Slogans

At its current stage, the slogans that are produced don't always make the most sense. If there were to be some measurement of how frequently words are found next to eachother, for example, more realistic slogans could be produced. 

### 3. Scale Up!!

Currently, the slogan generator can't always find a solution for a given acronym. There just aren't enough tweets for longer or more obsucre acronyms. As I improve this project, I will be keeping in mind how I can pump more data into the slogan maker and utilize it to make longer and more realistic slogans.
